We use this information to provide a service you request, such as medical care on board one of our cruises (whether in person or through our telehealth services), or special dietary accommodations, or in connection with your application for employment.\n",
      "If, while traveling with us, you allege a personal injury or submit a claim after alleging a personal injury, we may collect personal data concerning the alleged incident, including healthcare information.\n",
      "With your consent, we may use facial comparison technology to facilitate and expedite your embarkation and/or disembarkation by taking your photograph and matching it against the photograph we collected from you during check-in or embarkation. When there is a match, you will be able to board the ship or be checked out of your cruise.\n",
      "Separately, we may securely provide your disembarkation photograph to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”), who uses its own facial comparison technology to match the photograph against images of you that CBP already has on file from your passport, other travel documents or prior CBP border inspections. Once we receive verification of your identity from CBP, we will delete your disembarkation photograph immediately. We do not retain your facial recognition data beyond the duration of your cruise or use it for any other purpose other than those described above. If you are a U.S. citizen, CBP will maintain your photograph for no more than 12 hours. For certain non-U.S. citizens, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will store your photograph for a longer period. For more information on how CBP uses your biometric data, please visit www.cbp.gov/travel/biometrics.\n",
